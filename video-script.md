# Digital Twin - Video Script (90 seconds)

## Word-for-Word Script:

This is my Digital Twin - an AI-powered portfolio that doesn't just show my work, it actually understands it.

Most portfolios make you search through pages to find information, but with mine, you can just have a conversation. Meet Cloud - my AI assistant that can answer any question about my experience, skills, or projects.

Let me show you. I'll ask Cloud about my React experience.

As you can see, Cloud uses retrieval-augmented generation to pull accurate information from my actual portfolio data in real-time. It's not making things up - it's pulling from my real projects and experience.

But here's what makes this different from every other portfolio chatbot out there. Cloud isn't just reactive - it's autonomous.

Watch what happens when someone expresses interest in working together.

Cloud intelligently picks up on that intent, extracts the relevant details from our conversation, and automatically sends me a professional email notification with all the context I need. No forms. No friction. Just a natural conversation that actually leads somewhere.

Under the hood, this is built with Next.js 15, PostgreSQL for structured data, vector embeddings for semantic search, and powered by Groq AI to handle the intelligence layer.

So this isn't just a portfolio website. It's not just a chatbot. It's a digital twin that represents me professionally, working 24/7 to showcase my work and connect me with opportunities. And it's live right now.
